etc and many more.

Day 14: 
1. learnt about Interquartile Range in box-plots 
2.  explored heatmaps in flights data set 
3.   learnt about normalization of clustermaps in Seaborn
4. solved Seaborn exercises on 'titanic' dataset.

Summary 
1. Histogram : plots the distribution of the frequency of variables of a univariate data
2. Bargraph : uses bars , can have more than one category of data
3. scatterplot: uses dots to represent the relation , when a regression line is drawn it shows the variance from expected value
4. boxplot : used to plot the interquratile ranges (1st , and 3rd quarters , min and max values , and median) by means of a box
5. KDE : Kernal Density Estimation plots are used to plot the KDE line which is drawn from the sum of the normal distributions drawn about each figure.

Day 15: Completed Data Capstone Project on 911 Calls
